# 1:
There are N coins kept in a line. Each coin has two sides - one is colored gold and the other silver. You can flip two adjacent coins any number of times. You need to make the gold-colored side of every coin facing up. You are given the initial status of coins in a binary string s where '1' represents the gold side facing up and '0' represents the silver side facing up. If it is possible to make the gold-colored side of every coin facing up, return "Yes", otherwise return "No".

Geek has a list of integers and a value key. He is trying to find the mean of 

the element just less than or equal to the given key and
the element just greater than or equal to the given key
If either of them does not exist, take the value as -1. Both the values may even be the same.  
He has recently discovered the concept of Binary Search Tree. He is curious to see if he can use BST to solve this problem. Can you help him?

The mean of two numbers x and y is defined as ceil((x+y)/2).
For example,
if the numbers are 2 and 3 then mean is ceil(5/2) = ceil(2.5) = 3.
Here ceil(x) denotes the smallest integer that is not smaller than x.

# 3:

Given N and a square matrix adj[ ][ ] of size N*N, you have to find whether it is possible to construct a undirected weighted graph of N nodes numbered from 0 to N-1 such that minimum distance between ith and jth node is given by adj[i][j].
Note:

adj[i][i] = 0 for every i.
adj[i][j] = adj[j][i]
